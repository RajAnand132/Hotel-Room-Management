## Introduction

This project is a Spring Boot-based hotel room management system that allows for the addition and retrieval of room information. Below, we'll explore the key components, project flow, and API explanations.

# Technologies and Tools

- **Spring Boot:** The core framework used for building the project.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Responsible for handling data access and persistence.
- **H2 Database (or your preferred database system):** Stores room data.
- **RESTful APIs:** Used for communication with the system.

## Project Flow

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, focused on managing hotel room data. The core components of this project are:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and includes the `Room` entity, which defines room information such as room number, type, availability, and price.

- **Controller:** Handles HTTP requests and defines API endpoints for adding and retrieving room information.

- **Service:** Provides the business logic and interfaces with the data repository.

- **Repository:** Interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on room data.

## API Endpoints

### Adding a Room

To add a new room to the system, make a POST request to `/room` API endpoint with a JSON payload representing the new room. The `Room` entity includes room number, type, availability, and price.

Example Request:
- Endpoint
```
POST /room
```
Content-Type: application/json
```http
{
  "roomId": 1,
  "roomNumber": 101,
  "roomType": "DELUXE",
  "roomAvailable": true,
  "roomPrice": 150.00
}
```

### Retreiving a Room
- Endpoint

```
GET /rooms
```
Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of all rooms in the system.
